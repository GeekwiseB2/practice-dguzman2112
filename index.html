        <h3>My friend brought Geekwise to my attention shortly after we decided together that we wouldn't settle for dead-end jobs after graduating college. Ultimately, I want to be part of a sales or marketing team for a tech company but I realize that I wouldn't be able to without a thorough understanding of what goes into the products and services these companies offer. I want to be well-rounded in programming and developing and I have been growing more excited as I've delved deeper into this sub-culture. I look forward to learning all I can about this industry.</h3>
